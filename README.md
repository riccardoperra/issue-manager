# IssueManager
> An issue board manager made with Angular and AppWrite

## Introduction

*IssueManager* is an application built with Angular 14 and AppWrite
for the [AppWrite Hackathon](https://dev.to/devteam/announcing-the-appwrite-hackathon-on-dev-1oc0).

It's a small project management tool inspired by GitHub Projects,
leveraging of some AppWrite features such as `Realtime database` and `Functions`.

## Tech stack

The frontend is built with Angular 14 using entirely the new **Standalone Component** feature. 

It also includes [RxAngular](https://github.com/rx-angular/rx-angular), a toolset focused on runtime performance and template rendering,
and [taiga-ui](https://github.com/Tinkoff/taiga-ui), an awesome UI component library.
