### Create a new project

Each authenticated user has the possibility to create a new project to IssueManager. A project is a kanban board where you can track your tasks.

Creating a project involves a series of processes to create the user's workspace, in fact thanks to an [Appwrite `function`](./functions/create-project) that will first craete a new [Appwrite Team](https://appwrite.io/docs/client/teams) where the user which has created the project is the owner, next it will create a new [Appwrite Storage Bucket](https://appwrite.io/docs/client/storage) where users can upload their files, then it will finally creates the `Project` entity to the database.

A project can be either public or private. When creating a public project, every user is able to view it even if it cannot update it. Private projects, on the other hand, can only be seen and updated by team members.
